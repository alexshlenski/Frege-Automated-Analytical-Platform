[BLGT|0005]The independent news collective is
[BLGT|0006]teaching a new generation
[BLGT|0007]of journalists and citizens to
[BLGT|0008]spot the stories in plain
[BLGT|0009]sight.

[BLGT|0011]Subscribe Bellingcat
[BLGT|0012]has used open sources, such
[BLGT|0013]as satellite maps
[BLGT|0014]and social media posts, to
[BLGT|0015]unmask Russian spies
[BLGT|0016]and solve mysterious plane crashes.


[BLGT|0017]The independent news collective blends
[BLGT|0018]the investigative methods
[BLGT|0019]of citizen journalism
[BLGT|001A]with the guidelines
[BLGT|001B]of a traditional news outlet.


[BLGT|001C]It hopes to
[BLGT|001D]make open-source investigative techniques mainstream,
[BLGT|001E]setting an example in our
[BLGT|001F]era of vast data
[BLGT|0020]and “counterfactual communities.” On
[BLGT|0021]July 17, 2014, Malaysia Airlines
[BLGT|0022]Flight 17 (MH17) was shot
[BLGT|0023]down over eastern Ukraine.


[BLGT|0024]The attack occurred in an
[BLGT|0025]area controlled by pro-Russian separatists
[BLGT|0026]and seemed the result
[BLGT|0027]of a surface-to-air missile.


[BLGT|0028]Everyone on board was killed.


[BLGT|0029]The event triggered public outrage
[BLGT|002A]and an international season
[BLGT|002B]of the blame game.


[BLGT|002C]Western Europe, led
[BLGT|002D]by the U.S.
[BLGT|002E]and Ukraine, pointed fingers at
[BLGT|002F]Russia, while Russia
[BLGT|0030]tried to pin
[BLGT|0031]the blame on Ukraine,
[BLGT|0032]going so far
[BLGT|0033]as to claim
[BLGT|0034]a Ukrainian military jet
[BLGT|0035]tailed the commercial aircraft
[BLGT|0036]immediately before the disaster.


[BLGT|0037]Later that year, an investigative
[BLGT|0038]team put out
[BLGT|0039]a report linking
[BLGT|003A]the pro-Russian separatists to
[BLGT|003B]the Buk-M1 missile launcher likely
[BLGT|003C]responsible for the tragedy.


[BLGT|003D]The team compiled photos, satellite
[BLGT|003E]imagery, and video evidence to
[BLGT|003F]follow a missile transport from
[BLGT|0040]Donetsk to Snizhne
[BLGT|0041]immediately before the
[BLGT|0042]downing of the aircraft.


[BLGT|0043]They then confirmed
[BLGT|0044]the transport leaving
[BLGT|0045]the area later, sans one
[BLGT|0046]missile.


[BLGT|0047]This report was
[BLGT|0048]not filed by an NGO
[BLGT|0049]or a legacy news organization
[BLGT|004A]like the New York Times
[BLGT|004B]or Wall Street Journal,
[BLGT|004C]nor did the team
[BLGT|004D]have access to insider
[BLGT|004E]or classified information.


[BLGT|004F]Its authors were
[BLGT|0050]a small, independent collective
[BLGT|0051]of researchers and citizen journalists
[BLGT|0052]called Bellingcat, and their information
[BLGT|0053]came from social media posts,
[BLGT|0054]Google Maps satellite imagery,
[BLGT|0055]and videos uploaded to YouTube.


[BLGT|0056]In other words,
[BLGT|0057]the facts were out in
[BLGT|0058]the open for anyone to
[BLGT|0059]see.


[BLGT|005A]Bellingcat simply knew
[BLGT|005B]where to look.

[BLGT|0062]Images  Bellingcat
[BLGT|0063]was founded by Eliot Higgins,
[BLGT|0064]a citizen journalist
[BLGT|0065]who gained online prominence
[BLGT|0066]investigating weapons smuggling
[BLGT|0067]during the Syrian war.


[BLGT|0068]The collective’s report into
[BLGT|0069]the MH17 attack
[BLGT|006A]would serve as its breakthrough,
[BLGT|006B]and it would continue to
[BLGT|006C]improve our understanding
[BLGT|006D]of the tragic event
[BLGT|006E]and countering Russian disinformation.


[BLGT|006F]Since then, Bellingcat
[BLGT|0070]has legally registered
[BLGT|0071]as a foundation in
[BLGT|0072]the Netherlands and
[BLGT|0073]has continued to unearth consequential
[BLGT|0074]details to some
[BLGT|0075]of the most important news
[BLGT|0076]stories of the last decade,
[BLGT|0077]including the Syrian War,
[BLGT|0078]the Christchurch mosque massacre,
[BLGT|0079]and the poisonings
[BLGT|007A]of Yulia Skripal
[BLGT|007B]and Alexei Navalny.


[BLGT|007C]The foundation’s model
[BLGT|007D]of journalism is known
[BLGT|007E]as “open-source investigation.”
[BLGT|007F]According to Aric Toler, Bellingcat’s
[BLGT|0080]director of research
[BLGT|0081]and training, it’s less an
[BLGT|0082]overturning of investigative journalism
[BLGT|0083]than a “genre” within it.
[BLGT|0084]This type of investigation follows
[BLGT|0085]digital data trails that are
[BLGT|0086]freely available on
[BLGT|0087]the internet.


[BLGT|0088]The bread crumbs
[BLGT|0089]could be found in public
[BLGT|008A]records, media reports, photos on
[BLGT|008B]Twitter, or people silly enough
[BLGT|008C]to upload a video
[BLGT|008D]of themselves committing
[BLGT|008E]a crime on Parler.


[BLGT|008F]“Bellingcat’s rise reveals
[BLGT|0090]something new about our digitally
[BLGT|0091]mediated times: spying is
[BLGT|0092]no longer the preserve
[BLGT|0093]of nation states – anyone
[BLGT|0094]with an internet connection
[BLGT|0095]can do it.
[BLGT|0096]The balance between open
[BLGT|0097]and secret intelligence is shifting.


[BLGT|0098]The most useful stuff is
[BLGT|0099]often public,” writes Luke
[BLGT|009A]Harding for the Guardian.


[BLGT|009B]The vast amount
[BLGT|009C]of data available online allows
[BLGT|009D]Bellingcat’s researchers to piece together
[BLGT|009E]timelines or connect seemingly
[BLGT|009F]disparate events to reveal their
[BLGT|00A0]connective, underlying thread.


[BLGT|00A1]In its investigation into
[BLGT|00A2]the shooting of Ashli Babbitt,
[BLGT|00A3]researchers created a timeline
[BLGT|00A4]of radicalization through her social-media
[BLGT|00A5]footprint;


[BLGT|00A6]they also mapped her journey
[BLGT|00A7]during the Capitol Riot
[BLGT|00A8]by locating videos
[BLGT|00A9]showing her in
[BLGT|00AA]the crowd and
[BLGT|00AB]comparing background details to publicly
[BLGT|00AC]available floorplans of
[BLGT|00AD]the U.S. Capitol Building.


[BLGT|00AE]Like a fussy math teacher,
[BLGT|00AF]the foundation employs
[BLGT|00B0]a “show-your-work approach” to maintain
[BLGT|00B1]credibility, transparency, and back-of-the-book peeking.


[BLGT|00B2]Each article or report meticulously
[BLGT|00B3]presents its data points through
[BLGT|00B4]links and images,
[BLGT|00B5]building the trail
[BLGT|00B6]of evidence crumb-by-crumb.


[BLGT|00B7]By the end, readers
[BLGT|00B8]have seen the same evidence
[BLGT|00B9]as the researcher
[BLGT|00BA]and can decide
[BLGT|00BB]whether said evidence supports
[BLGT|00BC]the researcher’s conclusions.


[BLGT|00BD]Aware such evidence
[BLGT|00BE]can sometimes vanish—either
[BLGT|00BF]by the people
[BLGT|00C0]who upload it
[BLGT|00C1]or corporations fretting
[BLGT|00C2]over public relations—Bellingcat
[BLGT|00C3]has also gone to great
[BLGT|00C4]lengths to archive
[BLGT|00C5]and back up important data
[BLGT|00C6]before they are lost.


[BLGT|00C7]Does our society incentivize disinformation?
[BLGT|00C8]| Daniel Schmachtenberger www.youtube.com
[BLGT|00C9]While today Bellingcat employs
[BLGT|00CA]a small team
[BLGT|00CB]of journalists and editors, it
[BLGT|00CC]still relies on volunteers
[BLGT|00CD]and citizen journalists
[BLGT|00CE]willing to dedicate
[BLGT|00CF]the time and effort to
[BLGT|00D0]scrape the internet
[BLGT|00D1]for leads.


[BLGT|00D2]This, Toler told us in
[BLGT|00D3]our interview, is an advantage
[BLGT|00D4]to Bellingcat’s investigative methods.


[BLGT|00D5]While traditional news outlets contend
[BLGT|00D6]with shrinking budgets, less personnel,
[BLGT|00D7]and more information to wrangle
[BLGT|00D8]than ever, they simply lack
[BLGT|00D9]the resources necessary to explore
[BLGT|00DA]the deluge of data we
[BLGT|00DB]call the internet.


[BLGT|00DC]Conversely, Bellingcat can overcome these
[BLGT|00DD]barriers by tapping into
[BLGT|00DE]a pre-existing group
[BLGT|00DF]of enthusiasts who thrive on
[BLGT|00E0]a sense of devotion, interest,
[BLGT|00E1]and personal satisfaction.


[BLGT|00E2]And the more people
[BLGT|00E3]who team up to solve
[BLGT|00E4]a problem, the lighter
[BLGT|00E5]the work becomes.


[BLGT|00E6]But there are challenges.


[BLGT|00E7]“It’s a double-edged sword.


[BLGT|00E8]On the one hand, you
[BLGT|00E9]have a clear gap in
[BLGT|00EA]information.


[BLGT|00EB]It’s just not feasible
[BLGT|00EC]for large outlets to cover
[BLGT|00ED]this stuff to
[BLGT|00EE]the degree it should be.
[BLGT|00EF]But also, the people
[BLGT|00F0]who do have
[BLGT|00F1]time and do it, there’s
[BLGT|00F2]not as much responsibility on
[BLGT|00F3]them, and who knows
[BLGT|00F4]what they could
[BLGT|00F5]do that causes harm,” Toler
[BLGT|00F6]said.


[BLGT|00F7]Consider the open-sourced nature
[BLGT|00F8]of the evidence.


[BLGT|00F9]Bellingcat’s show-your-work approach is necessary
[BLGT|00FA]for clarity and transparency,
[BLGT|00FB]but it also creates
[BLGT|00FC]a set of instructions
[BLGT|00FD]for those looking to duplicate
[BLGT|00FE]the formula.


[BLGT|00FF]While Bellingcat maintains
[BLGT|0100]the guidelines of
[BLGT|0101]a traditional newsroom, others may
[BLGT|0102]not and bad actors
[BLGT|0103]could locate information Bellingcat
[BLGT|0104]deemed sensitive enough to redact
[BLGT|0105]and use it to harm
[BLGT|0106]others by, say, doxing.


[BLGT|0107]“There’s really no good solution
[BLGT|0108]because you can’t control
[BLGT|0109]what the mob does.


[BLGT|010A]If someone is angry, they
[BLGT|010B]can dig into this stuff
[BLGT|010C]because it is open source,
[BLGT|010D]and if you give
[BLGT|010E]the transparency of
[BLGT|010F]how you got your stuff,
[BLGT|0110]then you can’t avoid
[BLGT|0111]the fact that it
[BLGT|0112]can then be
[BLGT|0113]reproduced and found,” Toler said.


[BLGT|0114]Because of this, Bellingcat hopes
[BLGT|0115]to serve as
[BLGT|0116]a type of intermediary.


[BLGT|0117]Like a traditional newsroom, it
[BLGT|0118]vets its sources, sets up
[BLGT|0119]fail-safes to catch misinformation,
[BLGT|011A]and writes its reports to
[BLGT|011B]protect bystanders and prevent libel.


[BLGT|011C]It hopes these practices
[BLGT|011D]will serve as an example
[BLGT|011E]for citizen journalists to emulate.


[BLGT|011F]On the obverse, it aims
[BLGT|0120]to show established news outlets
[BLGT|0121]the power and reach
[BLGT|0122]of open-sourced investigative techniques
[BLGT|0123]and these online communities.


[BLGT|0124]Recently, Bellingcat has
[BLGT|0125]worked to investigate
[BLGT|0126]the Jan.6 Capitol Riots.

[BLGT|0128]Looking to the larger media
[BLGT|0129]landscape, Bellingcat doesn’t see itself
[BLGT|012A]in competition with traditional news
[BLGT|012B]media.


[BLGT|012C]It views its position
[BLGT|012D]as one of cooperation.


[BLGT|012E]The foundation has
[BLGT|012F]worked with several news partners
[BLGT|0130]to investigate stories
[BLGT|0131]and promote its work, such
[BLGT|0132]as sharing the findings
[BLGT|0133]of its Riley June Williams
[BLGT|0134]investigation with NBC.


[BLGT|0135]It also offers
[BLGT|0136]training workshops to teach open-source
[BLGT|0137]investigation.


[BLGT|0138]These are not
[BLGT|0139]only attended by journalists
[BLGT|013A]wishing to hone their skills
[BLGT|013B]but professionals like lawyers
[BLGT|013C]and finance managers
[BLGT|013D]looking to add these techniques
[BLGT|013E]to their trades.


[BLGT|013F]Because the foundation sees its
[BLGT|0140]methods as an extension
[BLGT|0141]of investigative journalism,
[BLGT|0142]not a replacement
[BLGT|0143]for it, it isn’t
[BLGT|0144]looking to corner
[BLGT|0145]a market.


[BLGT|0146]Rather, it aims to evolve
[BLGT|0147]a profession to meet
[BLGT|0148]the challenges of its new
[BLGT|0149]21st-century environment.


[BLGT|014A]As Toler told us: “Journalism
[BLGT|014B]doesn’t work one way
[BLGT|014C]or the other.


[BLGT|014D]It should be both.


[BLGT|014E]Do some open-source
[BLGT|014F]sleuthing to compliment
[BLGT|0150]and boost your on-the-ground reporting.


[BLGT|0151]“Our gospel of open source,
[BLGT|0152]we’re trying to spread that
[BLGT|0153]as much as we can.


[BLGT|0154]We want to
[BLGT|0155]make this a very mainstream
[BLGT|0156]part of traditional news.


[BLGT|0157]If we’re made obsolete, that’s
[BLGT|0158]a good thing
[BLGT|0159]because we’d like
[BLGT|015A]for more traditional news outlets
[BLGT|015B]to be doing digital investigation
[BLGT|015C]and verification work.”
