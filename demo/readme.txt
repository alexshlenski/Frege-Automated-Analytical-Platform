This directory contains Demo RCI Profiles that will help you to get some experience with RCI Interpreter.
A Demo Profile includes the following files:
- <project-name>-NRM.txt: a normalized source text (a field document or OSINT article) from which the Profile
has been created.
- <project-name>-ODS.json: Ontology Driven Scaffolding file, which is a human and LLM readable document.
- <project-name>-IFSN.txt: Inference Free Semantic Notation file, which is LLM-only readable. This file is the
backbone structure that gives RCI Interpreter most of analytical data.

The /deliverables subdirectory contains reports and diagrams created by RCI Ineterpreter in previous sessions,
to give you an idea, what kind of analytical output RCI Interpreter is capable to produce with the proper query.
